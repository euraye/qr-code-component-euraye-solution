## About The Project

<p>An excellent initial project for beginners in HTML and CSS, this challenge focuses on building a static QR code component. The layout is fixed, making it suitable if you're not yet familiar with responsive design. Your goal is to replicate the design accurately, and you can use any tools or techniques you wish to practice.
  
<br><br>Your users should be able to:
<br>1. View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

<br>

## Built with 

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

## What I learned

It's a straightforward project for someone who has recently learned HTML and CSS. The challenge lies in finding the right measurements for the components and adjusting the flexbox to ensure responsiveness across all screen sizes.

## Useful resources

1. <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a> - to have a visualization of your project that you will create. It's easy to know the exact size of your elements.
